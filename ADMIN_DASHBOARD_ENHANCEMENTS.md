# Admin Dashboard Enhancements

## Overview
This document summarizes the three major enhancements made to the Admin Dashboard as requested.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Logo Change (Top-Left Corner)
**Location**: `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Navbar section

**Change Made**:
- **Before**: Orange shield icon with gradient background
- **After**: Synnectify logo image (`/logo.png`)

**Code Change**:
```tsx
// Before:
<div className="flex items-center justify-center w-10 h-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-600 to-red-600 rounded-lg">
  <Shield className="w-6 h-6 text-white" />
</div>

// After:
<img src="/logo.png" alt="SYNNECTIFY Logo" className="w-10 h-10 object-contain" />
```

**Result**: The admin panel now displays the official Synnectify logo in the top-left corner of the navbar.

### 2. ✅ Delete Button for Applications
**Location**: 
- Frontend: `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Application action buttons
- Backend: `server/routes/applications.js` - New DELETE endpoint

**Changes Made**:

#### Frontend:
- Added `deleteApplication` function with confirmation dialog
- Added Delete button with Trash2 icon next to Shortlist/Reject/Ignore buttons
- Button styling: Red background (`bg-red-600`) with hover effect

**Code Added**:
```tsx
const deleteApplication = async (appId: string) => {
  if (!authToken) return;
  if (!confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this application? This action cannot be undone.")) return;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/applications/${appId}`, {
      method: "DELETE",
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}` },
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      fetchData();
      alert("Application deleted successfully");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error deleting application:", error);
    alert("Failed to delete application");
  }
};
```

**Delete Button**:
```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => deleteApplication(app._id)}
  className="bg-red-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-red-700 transition-colors text-sm flex items-center"
  title="Delete application permanently"
>
  <Trash2 className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
  Delete
</button>
```

#### Backend:
- Added DELETE route: `DELETE /api/applications/:id`
- Requires admin authentication (JWT token)
- Permanently removes application from database

**Backend Code**:
```javascript
router.delete('/:id', verifyToken, requireAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const application = await Application.findByIdAndDelete(id);
    if (!application) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Application not found' });
    }
    res.json({ message: 'Application deleted successfully' });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error deleting application:', err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Server error' });
  }
});
```

**Result**: Admins can now permanently delete applications with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.

### 3. ✅ Add New Job Position Feature
**Location**: `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Jobs tab

**Changes Made**:

#### State Management:
```tsx
const [showJobModal, setShowJobModal] = useState(false);
const [newJob, setNewJob] = useState({
  title: "",
  description: "",
  location: "",
  type: "",
});
```

#### Create Job Function:
```tsx
const createJob = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (!authToken) return;

  if (!newJob.title || !newJob.description || !newJob.location || !newJob.type) {
    alert("Please fill in all fields");
    return;
  }

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/jobs`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(newJob),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      fetchData();
      setShowJobModal(false);
      setNewJob({ title: "", description: "", location: "", type: "" });
      alert("Job created successfully!");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating job:", error);
    alert("Failed to create job");
  }
};
```

#### UI Components Added:

1. **"Add New Job" Button** (in Jobs tab header):
```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => setShowJobModal(true)}
  className="bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-600 to-red-600 hover:from-orange-700 hover:to-red-700 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg transition-all flex items-center gap-2 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg font-semibold"
>
  <Briefcase className="w-5 h-5" />
  Add New Job
</button>
```

2. **Job Creation Modal** with form fields:
   - **Job Title** (required) - Text input
   - **Description** (required) - Textarea (4 rows)
   - **Location** (required) - Text input
   - **Job Type** (required) - Dropdown select (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Internship)
   - **Cancel** button - Closes modal and resets form
   - **Create Job** button - Submits the form

**Modal Features**:
- Full-screen overlay with semi-transparent black background
- Centered modal with gradient header (orange to red)
- Form validation (all fields required)
- Responsive design (max-width 2xl, scrollable content)
- Focus styling on inputs (orange ring on focus)
- Professional UI matching the existing admin panel design

**Result**: Admins can now create new job positions directly from the admin panel without needing database access.
