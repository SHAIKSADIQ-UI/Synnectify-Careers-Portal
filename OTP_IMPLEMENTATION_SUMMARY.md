# OTP Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement OTP verification for admin login without altering any existing functionality, animations, or logic in the project.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Authentication Routes (`server/routes/auth.js`)

- **Modified admin login endpoint** (`/admin-login`):

  - Implemented OTP generation with 5-minute expiration
  - Integrated with existing mailer utility to send OTP via email
  - Added proper error handling and response messages

- **Added OTP verification endpoint** (`/admin-verify-otp`):
  - Validates OTP against stored hashed value
  - Checks OTP expiration (5-minute timeout)
  - Prevents OTP reuse
  - Generates JWT token upon successful verification
  - Added proper error handling and response messages

### 2. Environment Configuration (`server/.env`)

- Maintained existing Google App Password for authentication
- Updated SMTP settings for Gmail integration

### 3. Mailer Utility (`server/utils/mailer.js`)

- Ensured proper reply-to address configuration
- Maintained existing error handling and logging

### 4. OTP Model (`server/models/OTP.js`)

- Maintained automatic cleanup of expired OTPs

## Frontend Changes

- **Enhanced login flow**:
  - Added two-step process: credentials â†’ OTP verification
