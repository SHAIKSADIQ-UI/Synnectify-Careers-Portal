# Job Application Submission Error - Fixed

## Problem
Job application form was showing error: **"Failed to send. Try again or contact us."** when users tried to submit applications.

## Root Cause
**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) blocking issue:**

- **Frontend** running on: `http://localhost:5175`
- **Backend** running on: `http://localhost:5000`
- **Backend CORS configuration** only allowed: `http://localhost:5173` and `http://localhost:5174`

When the frontend (port 5175) tried to send a POST request to the backend (port 5000), the browser blocked it due to CORS policy mismatch.

## Investigation Steps
1. ✅ Verified backend server was running on port 5000 (using `netstat -ano | findstr :5000`)
2. ✅ Checked frontend running on port 5175 (Vite auto-selected after 5173 and 5174 were in use)
3. ✅ Reviewed `server/server.js` CORS configuration
4. ✅ Identified missing port 5175 in `allowedOrigins` array

## Solution
Updated `server/server.js` to include port 5175 in the CORS allowed origins:

```javascript
// BEFORE
const allowedOrigins = [
  process.env.CLIENT_URL,
  'http://localhost:5173',
  'http://localhost:5174'
].filter(Boolean);

// AFTER
const allowedOrigins = [
  process.env.CLIENT_URL,
  'http://localhost:5173',
  'http://localhost:5174',
  'http://localhost:5175'  // ✅ ADDED
].filter(Boolean);
```

## Changes Made
1. **File Modified**: `server/server.js`
   - Added `'http://localhost:5175'` to the `allowedOrigins` array
   
2. **Backend Restart**: Restarted the backend server to apply CORS changes
   - Server now running with updated CORS policy
   - MongoDB connected successfully

## Testing
After the fix, the job application form should now:
- ✅ Successfully submit applications
- ✅ Send POST request to `http://localhost:5000/api/applications/apply`
- ✅ Upload resume files
- ✅ Send confirmation emails to applicants
- ✅ Send notification emails to `careers.synnectify@gmail.com`

## Technical Details

### Application Flow:
1. User fills job application form
2. Form data + resume file sent as `FormData` to backend
3. Backend saves application to MongoDB
4. Backend sends 2 emails:
   - Company notification to `careers.synnectify@gmail.com`
   - Applicant confirmation to user's email
5. Success response returned to frontend

### Files Involved:
- **Frontend**: `src/pages/JobApplicationForm.tsx` (unchanged - as requested)
- **Backend**: `server/server.js` (CORS fix only)
- **Backend Route**: `server/routes/applications.js` (unchanged)
- **Backend Config**: `server/.env` (unchanged)

## Notes
- ✅ No changes made to backend job application logic (as per user request)
- ✅ Only configuration (CORS) was updated
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Backend server restarted successfully

**Fixed on**: 2025-10-18  
**Issue**: CORS blocking frontend requests  
**Resolution**: Added port 5175 to CORS allowed origins
