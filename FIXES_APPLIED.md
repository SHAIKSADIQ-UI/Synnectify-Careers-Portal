## 🎯 ISSUES FIXED

### 1. ✅ **Profile Image Display Issue**
**Problem**: User profile image showing as orange circle instead of actual photo

**Root Cause**: 
- Image not being displayed properly
- Text color was not visible on header (black text on black background)

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `UserProfile.tsx` to properly display user photo from Firebase
- Added fallback to initials if photo fails to load
- Changed text color to white for better visibility on header
- Added `object-cover` class for proper image scaling
- Added error handling for broken images

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/UserProfile.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ **Application Submission Failing**
**Problem**: "Failed to send. Try again or contact us." error when submitting application

**Root Cause**: Wrong API endpoint URL

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed API endpoint from `http://localhost:5000/api/apply` to `http://localhost:5000/api/applications/apply`
- This matches the correct backend route structure

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/JobApplicationForm.tsx`

**Backend Route**: 
```javascript
router.post('/apply', ...) // In applications.js
// Access via: /api/applications/apply
```

---

### 3. ✅ **View Details Button Added to Dashboard**
**Problem**: No way to see job requirements and responsibilities in dashboard

**Fix Applied**:
- Added "View Details" button for each job listing
- Added expand/collapse functionality
- Shows requirements (green checkmarks)
- Shows responsibilities (blue checkmarks)
- Smooth toggle animation with chevron icons

**Features**:
```typescript
- ChevronDown icon when collapsed
- ChevronUp icon when expanded
- Requirements with green checkmarks
- Responsibilities with blue checkmarks
- Grid layout (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

---

### 4. ✅ **Job Requirements & Responsibilities Display**
**Problem**: Job criteria (requirements/responsibilities) not visible in dashboard

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `requirements[]` and `responsibilities[]` to Job interface
- Implemented expandable details section
- Displays when "View Details" is clicked
- Organized in 2-column grid
- Uses CheckCircle icons for visual clarity

**UI Layout**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Job Title        [Department Badge] │
│ Description...                      │
│ Location | Type | Experience | $$$  │
│                                     │
│ ┌─ Requirements ─┐ ┌─ Responsib. ─┐│
│ │ ✓ Item 1       │ │ ✓ Item 1     ││
│ │ ✓ Item 2       │ │ ✓ Item 2     ││
│ └────────────────┘ └──────────────┘│
│                                     │
│ [View Details]  [Apply Now]         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5. ✅ **Email Sending After Application Submission**
**Problem**: Confirmation needed that emails are being sent

**Status**: ✅ **Already Implemented & Working**

**How It Works**:
1. **Application Submitted** → Triggers two emails:

#### Email 1: To Company (careers.synnectify@gmail.com)
```
Subject: New Job Application Received - [Position]
Content:
- Applicant details (name, email, phone, DOB, LinkedIn)
- Position applied for
- Application date
- Resume attachment location
```

#### Email 2: To Applicant (User's email)
```
Subject: Application Received - [Position] at SYNNECTIFY
Content:
- Confirmation of receipt
- Position details
- Status: Pending Review
- Expected response timeframe (5-7 business days)
- Professional HTML template
```

**Email Templates**: Professional HTML with gradient headers, company branding

**Files Implementing Emails**:
- `server/routes/applications.js` (lines 81-164)
- `server/utils/mailer.js` (Nodemailer configuration)
