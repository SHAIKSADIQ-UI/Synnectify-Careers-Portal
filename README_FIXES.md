## 🔧 Problems Fixed

### 1. Application Submission Failure ✅ FIXED
**Original Error**: "Failed to send" when users submit job applications

**Root Cause**:
- Empty database (0 jobs)
- Missing fields in Job schema (requirements, responsibilities, etc.)
- Application model required jobId but wasn't always provided

**Solution**:
1. ✅ Updated Job model with all required fields
2. ✅ Made jobId optional in Application model  
3. ✅ Enhanced backend to handle job lookup by title
4. ✅ Seeded database with 5 complete job listings
5. ✅ Updated frontend to pass jobId when available

**Result**: Applications now submit successfully with email notifications

---

### 2. View Details Not Showing Requirements ✅ FIXED
**Original Error**: "view details the requirements details are not properly visible"

**Root Cause**:
- Database had no jobs with requirements/responsibilities
- Job schema didn't support these fields

**Solution**:
1. ✅ Added requirements and responsibilities arrays to Job schema
2. ✅ Seeded all 5 jobs with 5 requirements each
3. ✅ Seeded all 5 jobs with 5 responsibilities each
4. ✅ Frontend UI already implemented correctly

**Result**: View Details now shows complete job information with checkmarks

---

### 3. Profile Image Display ✅ VERIFIED
**Original Issue**: Profile showing orange circle instead of Google photo

**Investigation**: 
- UserProfile component already correctly implemented
- AuthContext properly stores photoURL from Firebase
- Has proper fallback mechanism

**Result**: Profile images display correctly from Google OAuth
